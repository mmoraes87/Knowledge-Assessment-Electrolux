The codes shown here are to be used together with the answers provived by e-mail.

The codes were written for an Arduino Mega (Atmega2560) board. With exception of question number 4, the codes are fully functional.

Due to the short time available, question number 4 could not be made functional because Arduino IDE already implements Interrupt Service Routines for hardware serial. To configure the microcontroller using the related registers for the hardware serial would've taken more time to go through the data sheet.
